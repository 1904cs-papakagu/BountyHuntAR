## ABOUT

This is a cross-platform mobile multiplayer game, featuring AR and GPS technology. The “aim” is for players to find and eliminate a target by going to a “hot” location in real life and shooting the target in AR.

## RULES

Players earn points and virtual cash which can be spent on ammunition or upgrades. Points are deducted for harming civilians and other bystanders. Extra points are awarded for neutralizing other competing players in the same killzone.

Eliminate the target before any other player can to earn $$$ and 3 points:
